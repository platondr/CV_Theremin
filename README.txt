CV Theremin

The project creates a theremin, using computer vision
A theremin is an electric musical instrument controlled by hand movement. It has two metal rods (one horizontal for volume and one vertical for pitch) that sense the distance to the hands to determine pitch and volume of the sound produced.
The theremin creates sound based on the position of the index fingers of both hands (the hand to the left controls volume, the hand to the right controls the pitch of the sound)
The interface shows the lines, that represent the arms of a real-life theremin - one for volume (if the hand gets lower and closer to the line, the volume gets lower) and one for the pitch (if the hand gets closer to the line, the pitch gets higher). The program works only if both hands are in the picture and the hand that controls pitch is to the right of the pitch line.

The project requires the libraries from 'requirements.txt' to be installed

To run the project, you must download 'main.py' and 'audio_generation.py', set up a python interpreter for the project, install the libraries from 'requirements.txt', and start the 'main.py' file, to close it, you should stop 'main.py' or press the 'X' button.

My interpretation of the theremin is a fun thing to mess around with, however it can also be used to record interesting sounds.
You can see the usage examples in the 'tests' folder.
Currently, the project is completed and no bugs are detected, however using a computer with a bad sound card may result in a clicking noise.
