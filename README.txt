CV Theremin
The project creates a theremin, using computer vision
The theremin creates sound based on the position of the index fingers of both hands (the hand to the left controls volume, the hand to the right controls the pitch of the sound)
The interface shows the lines, that represent the arms of a real-life theremin - one for volume (the closer to it the hand gets, the quieter the theremin is) and one for the pitch (the closer to the line the hand gets, the higher the pitch). The program works only if both hands are in the picture and the hand that controls pitch is to the right of the pitch line.

The project requires the libraries from 'requirements.txt' to be installed

To run the project, you must download 'main.py' and 'audio_generation.py', install the libraries from 'requirements.txt', and start the 'main.py' file, to close it, you should stop 'main.py'.

The theremin is a fun thing to mess around with, however it can also be used to record interesting sounds.
Currently, the project is completed.
